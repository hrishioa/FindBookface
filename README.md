# Find Bookface

This is a simple chrome extension to make searching bookface faster by adding an option to the context menu and omnibox (see screenshots below). No permissions other than context menu needed.

## How to Install

The extension is pending review on the store. For now, you can [download the extension from this repository](https://github.com/hrishioa/FindBookface/raw/master/assets/findbookface.crx), navigate to `chrome://extensions`, enable Developer Mode in the top right and drag it in.
Of course, make sure you take a look at [the code first](ext/src/bg/background.js) - allt 26 lines!

## Help

Requests and updates welcome! This has definitely been [worth the time for me](https://xkcd.com/1205/), hope it does the same for you.

(If you're not sure, YOU NEED TO BE LOGGED INTO BOOKFACE!)
